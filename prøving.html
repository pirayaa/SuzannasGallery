    <h2>PROGRESSION</h2>
    <br>
    <p6>

        These paintings are the once she has dedicated the year to. As you can see they follow a certain city based theme.
        Some of them more abstract then the others.
        In addition to her previous work, where she mainly painted nature, this style reflects a certain melancholy.
    While her previous work was more a reflection of something old and beautiful. Her new work reflects something new
        and if it is beautiful is yet to be decided.

    <h3> Artists note: </h3>
        <br>
        I hope my work is able to wake up some sort of emotion in the people watching them. In regards to my newest pieces i hope
        the people who sees them will think about how it is to walk in the city. Something that can be hard while being in a city
        because then the feeling can be undescribable and overwhelming. I hope these paintings will help people seeing the city from a
        different point of view
